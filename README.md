# JavScript DOM Manipulation
## Restaurant website created by JavaScript

A simple restaurant home page generated by JavaScript. It has tabbed browsing which triggers a Javascript function to wipe out the current page then create the desired page.

This is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) JavaScript track. See [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/manipulating-the-dom-with-jquery?ref=lc-pb) for more information.
